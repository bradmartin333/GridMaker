This demo converts the **A** grid to RR and RC coordinates, the **B** grid to R and C coordinates and the **C** grid to SR and SC coordinates.

Here is a representation of the same grid, where Black = **Origin / A**, Red = **A**, Green = **B**, Blue = **C**. The coordinate system is designed for systems with their origin in the SW corner.
