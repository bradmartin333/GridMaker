- Depending on the Host UI configuration, grids can be organized by Row (Y) Column (X) (As seen above) or X Y. 
- After clicking *Validate and Save*, the preview form can be opened via the icon that looks like 3 horizontal bars. This form shows the path to be taken throughout the grid as well as display relevant info for each point on the grid.

- A *Callback* can be enabled for each of the 3 grid levels. This is a flag that can be handled by the Host UI. 
- *Skipped Indices* can be manually typed in or selected via GUI by clicking the pencil icon next to the entry box.
